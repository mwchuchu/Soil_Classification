# Soil Classification Project

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify different types of soil: Alluvial Soil, Red Soil, Clay Soil, and Black Soil. The model is trained using a labeled dataset of soil images and deployed via a Streamlit web interface.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to assist in agricultural planning and soil management by providing accurate soil type predictions based on image inputs.

## Model Architecture

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Used for feature extraction and classification.
- **Activation Function**: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) for introducing non-linearity.
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer for adaptive learning rates and faster convergence.
- **Loss Function**: Cross-entropy loss for multi-class classification.


## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Pillow


### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
